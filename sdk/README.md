# Solana SDK

Use the Solana SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Solana Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/dolly-program) instead.

More information about Solana is available in the [Solana documentation](https://dolly.com/docs).

The [Solana Program Library](https://github.com/dolly-labs/dolly-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
